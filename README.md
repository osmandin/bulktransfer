## File Transfer Utility

### Deployment

Create the jar file by using the Mainfest.txt

jar cfm filetransferutility.jar Manifest.txt yale/*.class

You must be in production/out directory for this to happen. javac it if the directory does not exist.

Drop it on Tomcat for distribution (or share via other means).
