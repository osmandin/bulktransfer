Mac Instructions
------------------

1) Open Finder / select "Go" / select "Connect to Server...".
2) Enter server address: "smb://storage.yale.edu/home/fc_Beinecke_807001-YUL"

This will mount the share. Make sure that you can see the folder you want to copy in Finder. Sometimes, Finder
freezes due a bug and this would prevent the application from seeing the folder in the first place.

If you experience this, just unmount/disconnect the share by clicking on the eject icon,
and try a minute or so later.

3) Now start the program with "java -jar bulk.jar". Click on "Browse Source Folder".
4) Browse to "Volumes" (typically under "Macintosh HD") and select the relevant directory within the share (typically labelled 'home').
5) Select the target folder.
6) Select Overwrite if you want your target files to be replaced.
7) Specify folders of interest in the identifiers box.
8) Once you click "Copy", the Info box and progress bar will update.

When done, unmount the share via Finder.
